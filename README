This is my Custom RESTful server.
This is completely custom PHP Code (no framework except my own)
Of course this has no "user" interface and at this time only returns json. 

The authentication is HTTP Auth.
Using SSL I think should be pretty secure. I was considering HTTP Digest but that only secures the password not the transmission so I'm not sure that's the best solution?


The models in this server can be database, file, or functions which I think adds to the flexibility since it's not always a database table.
If you do decide to use a database table probably one of the most common types full CRUD support is included.

The GUI to manage the users, access, logs, modules and settings is also included under the /admin folder (this can be changed)
The GUI is based off of CodeIgniter the PHP MVC Framework and the CSS is Twitter Bootstrap.

In addition this also includes a installer for the server/admin gui.

Included with the RestFul server is the "hello world" of javascript frameworks a "todo" application.
This example uses my jmvc jquery mvc framework

This is a MVC Framework which makes it easier to create client side applications

It includes:

Personally Coded Libs Include
jquery.mvcboot.js - configs and boot strap
jquery.mvc.js - core functions
jquery.mvcform.js - form functions
jquery.mvcmodel.js - model functions (the basic CRUD coupled with the RESTful server)
jquery.session.js - simulated PHP like sessions.

3rd Party Open Source libraries used
jquery.cookie.js - better cookie handling
jquery.json-2.2.js - JSON
jstorage.js - jQuery Client side storage
jquery.tmpl.js - jQuery templates (views)

Of course the example and jmvc use the RESTful server/api to do all of the CRUD

All of these can be used together or decoupled pretty easily.
